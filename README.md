This web application is an interactive map that visualizes violent crime patterns across Texas between the years 2009 and 2019. The application displays a comparison map of crime rates in cities across Texas for the two selected years. Users can switch between 2009 and 2019 crime datasets, query cities based on crime rate and total crime, and create buffers around high crime areas. The application utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and ArcGIS JavaScript API 4.x. Feature layers and attribute tables are hosted on ArcGIS Online and accessed through the ArcGIS REST service. The crime information is derived from the Texas Department of Public Safety Open Data Hub.
